# Rolling Dice

Rolling a dice may sound simple, but it can be trickier than it seems. In this project, we'll explore how to make a cube roll towards a target using Unity.
## Introduction

This repository is a demonstration of how to create a simple AI agent that rotates and moves a cube toward a specified target. The cube will use the most efficient path to reach the target while maintaining a smooth and visually appealing roll.
